# Resource management

With mogenius you should always have full control and transparency over the use of your cloud resources. There are several ways to do this and we will cover them here.

## Available resources in your plan

First, it is important to understand how resources are distributed in your Cloudspace. The plan you choose when creating a Cloudspace determines your total available resources ([Check out the available plans](#)). You can then allocate resources to your services, which will set limits in maximum resource consumption for each service. This means, a service does not necessarily consume the full amount of allocated resources. You will see the summary of resource consumption over every stage and service on the dashboard of your Cloudspace.

Inside mogenius studio, you will get an overview of resource consumption at every level of detail. On the page Stages & Services all the metrics from services will be summarized per stage. You can then monitor single services inside every stage.
