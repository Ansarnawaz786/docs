**Description**
_Bitwarden_ is an integrated open source password management solution for individuals, teams, and business organizations.
You can install a alternative implementation of the Bitwarden server API written in Rust and compatible with upstream Bitwarden clients*, perfect for self-hosted deployment where running the official resource-heavy service might not be ideal.
