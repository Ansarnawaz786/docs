# Key Vault

The Key Vault stores your environment variables with full encryption (read more about this [here](./../development/environment-variables-and-secrets.md)). There are two ways to fill your Key Vault:
1. Set environment variables while [creating a service](services.md). They are stored in your Key Vault automatically.
2. Create a secret in your Key Vault with the button "Add secret". You can set the `Key` manually or you can generate it through the magic wand.
