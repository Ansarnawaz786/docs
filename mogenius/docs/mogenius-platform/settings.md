## Manage your team

In this section, you can manage team members who contribute to this cloudspace. When you add members, they receive an invitation by email to join the cloudspace. Once they accept the invitation, the cloudspace is accessible in their mogenius account. Similarly, if you delete members from the cloudspace, they would lose access. 

You can set the role of a user when you send an invitation, and you can change the role later.
