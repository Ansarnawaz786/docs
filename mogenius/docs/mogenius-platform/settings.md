## General Cloudspace settings

|Input field|Description|
|---|---|
|Name|The name of your Cloudspace can not be changed after creation as it is used in the hostname.|
|Description|You can give your Cloudspace a description to tell other users what the project is about.|
|Git Area|This area shows the Github Account that your Cloudspace might be connected to.|
|Critical Area|Deactivate Cloudspace: This feature is currently under development <br />Delete Cloudspace: This will delete your Cloudspace irrevocably with all data that is inside.|

## Manage your team

In this area you can manage team members that collaborate on this Cloudspace. When you add members they will receive an invite per email to join the Cloudspace. Once they accept the invite, the Cloudspace is accessible in their mogenius account. The same way they would lose access if you delete members from the Cloudspace.  

You can define a user's role when sending an invite and you can change the role later.
