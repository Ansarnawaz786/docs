# Dashboard

**Description**
The dashboard is your control center where you can find all relevant information about your cloudspace at a glance.
Here you can see the resource allocation, the status of your stages and services and the latest messages.

## Resource widget
[Bild widget]
On the resource widget you will find the overall informations about the allocation of your resources. The widget displays the following types and values:

|Type|Unit  |Value|
|--|--|--|
| CPU | allocated |core|
| RAM | allocated |GB|
| Storage | in use |GB|
| Traffic | consumption |GB|
| Temp. Storage | in use |GB|

**Allocated** = the value that already installed services take up.
**In use** = the value of resources already in use
**Consumed** = the value that has already been consumed

The widget is designed to show all stages and their individual resource consumption. For example, if you have several stages, they are displayed in colour. This way you always have an overview of the general consumption and the consumption per stage.
