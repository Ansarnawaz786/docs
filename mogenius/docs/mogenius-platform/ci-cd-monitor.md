# CI/CD monitor

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery. It is a software distribution method used by development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. CI/CD involves two complementary approaches, both of which rely heavily on automation.

In the Continuous Integration process, development teams implement small, regular code changes and merge them into a shared repository. 

Continuous Delivery is a workflow engine that allows you to trigger processes such as testing for bugs and uploading code changes from the development team to a staging repository.
