- **Free plan:** This plan is available for everyone without entering payment details. Test the platform as long as you like and deploy first services to prepare your setup.
- **Starter plan:** The starter plan enables you to launch any service inside mogenius. It contains enough resources to cover multiple services and for example a MySQL database. 
- **Advanced plan:** The advanced plan is the best to run a project with a first concurring userbase. Start scaling from here and professionalize your application.
- **Professional plan:** The professional plan is designed for larger projects, sophisticated applications and a high number of users on your application. 

**If you want to plan your approximate resource requirements, take a look at [Services](./../services/service-overview.md) to see the resource requirements for any specific service at initial launch.**
